# DVD-Rental-Project
A collection of some the skills acquire as Data-Analyst

In This project the reader can find some of the SQL techniques used to explore a DVD rental database (SQL_comand_summary file).
The exploration goes from data cleaning to data assembly, from sub-queries to join tables, to create new table with different coding techniques.
A EGR image of the database is also reported together with the dataset (.tar file) itself.
